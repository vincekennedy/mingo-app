# 🎯 Mingo

**Mingo** is a browser-based bingo game creator built for **distributed play**. It allows anyone to create a bingo game from a custom list, share a short join code, and let participants receive randomized boards — no installs, no player accounts, just instant gameplay.

This project was intentionally built as a **hands-on experiment in modern, AI-assisted web development**, leveraging tools like **Claude**, **Cursor**, **Linear**, and **Vercel** to explore how they can accelerate ideation, execution, and iteration for a simple but complete product.

## 🧠 Project Intent

Mingo was created to:

- Explore **AI-assisted development workflows** (“vibe coding”) end to end  
- Practice shipping a **small, well-scoped web product** quickly  
- Evaluate how modern tools can reduce friction across:
  - Product definition
  - Implementation
  - Iteration
  - Deployment

As a full-time mobile engineer with web experience, this project served as a focused way to apply product thinking and modern web tooling outside my primary platform.

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 **Custom Bingo Creation**  
  Create a bingo game with a list of 8+ custom items (depending on board size).

- 🔐 **Shareable Game Codes**  
  Each game generates a short alphanumeric code players use to join.

- 🧩 **Randomized Boards**  
  Every participant receives a unique board generated from the same item pool.

- 🌐 **Browser-Based & Distributed**  
  Works seamlessly for remote or in-person groups.

- ⚡ **Fast & Serverless**  
  Deployed on Vercel for low-latency performance and simple scaling.

## 🛠️ Tooling & Workflow

This project emphasizes **tool integration and effective usage**, not just the final result.

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development
- **Claude**  
  - Feature ideation and product framing  
  - Generating and refining logic for board randomization and game flow  
  - Iterative problem-solving and refactoring

- **Cursor**  
  - AI-assisted coding directly in the editor  
  - Rapid iteration on UI, state management, and edge cases  
  - Used as a collaborative development partner rather than code generation alone

### 📋 Product & Planning
- **Linear**  
  - Lightweight issue tracking and task breakdown  
  - Translating ideas into scoped, shippable units of work  
  - Maintaining momentum without over-engineering

### 🚀 Deployment
- **Vercel**  
  - Zero-config deployment  
  - Preview environments for fast iteration  
  - Serverless-friendly architecture

## 📚 What This Project Demonstrates

- Ability to **scope and ship** a complete product independently  
- Practical use of **AI tools as accelerators**, not replacements  
- Comfort moving between **product thinking and implementation**  
- Clear, maintainable execution of a simple but real-world web app  
- Willingness to experiment, evaluate tooling, and iterate quickly
